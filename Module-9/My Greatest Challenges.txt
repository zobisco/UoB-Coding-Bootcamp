I believe the challenge I will face and struggle with the most is finding the time to complete all the coursework in time.
For example, I have been particularly busy these past few months, and I have only just been able to start the pre-work.
Although I have worked very hard in these last few days, I have also had to really push myself, and carve out some time.
Although this was possible and worked out for me on this occasion, since I have been able to complete all the pre-work in time, I will need to step up my game and keep up the momentum, if I am to succeed in this bootcamp.
I work a full-time job and the coding bootcamp is going to be very time and energy intensive. I am looking to give it my all and take all the necessary steps to submit all my assignments on time and to a level of quality I am satisfied with.
This will involve setting aside some time each day to complete the work needed, and not leaving this till the last minute.
I have full confidence that I will keep up with the lessons and the coursework, and deliver really good work.
