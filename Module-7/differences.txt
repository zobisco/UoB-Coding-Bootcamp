There were quite a few mistakes to fix:

BrokenCode HTML file:

- In general, there were quite a few indentation issues
- The div tags were also in the wrong order

Specifically, I found the following errors:

- Line 19: Missing <h1> tag
- Lines 27-9: <h4> tags should have been <p> tags
- Lines 40-3: <h4> tags should have been <p> tags
- Lines 50: Missing angled brackets and alt text for image
- Lines 72-6: Missing <li> tags in list
- Lines 88-90: Incorrectly named buttons / ids (e.g. id="textGreen">Orange)

errors.js file:

- Line 6: The array was missing the correct number of quotation marks
- Lines 20 & 25: The word "click" was missing quotation marks
